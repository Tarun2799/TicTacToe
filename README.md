In this project, I learn ::after and ::before in CSS and how to use them to create X and O and how to create cool hover effect for the current player.
In JS, I learn some methods of Array like some(), every(). And contain(), how to create logic of this game with these methods.
I also added some media query for adding responsiveness to this app.
